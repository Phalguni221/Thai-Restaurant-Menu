        <p>This restaurant was set up by hardworking Thai family the Siriwans. Mr. and Mrs. Siriwan, who immigrated from Bangkok,Thailand in the 80s 
            first to Manhattan, New York. After earning enough money, the Siriwans were able to open their dream restaurant right in the heart of New York City! Almost 30 years later, H-Thai-ML is stil a 
            popular place, frequently visited by both locals and tourists! As mentioned above, the Siriwans were fortunate and successful enough with the Manhattan branch that they were able to spread their 
        love for Thai cuisine to other cities across America! </p>
